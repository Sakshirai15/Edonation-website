# E-Donation-Website

## OVERVIEW
*An **E-donation website** for unused products is a platform designed to facilitate the donation of items that individuals no longer need or use,
allowing them to contribute to charitable causes while helping others in their community. This README outlines the objectives, problem statement and the techincal stacks
for the development of the website.*
## OBJECTIVES

**The primary objectives of creating an e-donation website are as follows:**

### •	Facilitate Charitable Giving
Provide an easy and accessible platform for users to make donations of items not in use to their chosen causes.

### •	Raise Awareness
Promote various charitable organizations and their missions, encouraging users to engage with important social issues.

### •	Increases Product Reusability
Allows users to donate items not in their use to people in need.

### •	Build Community Engagement
Foster connections between donors, receivers and social organizations, creating a supportive community.

### •	Security and Transparency
Ensure secure connections and provide transparency regarding the condition of the product. 

### •	Recurring Donations
Offer options for donors to set up recurring contributions.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT

*The current landscape for donating unused products is hampered by a lack of awareness, inefficient donation management, and limited communication between donors and organizations.
Many potential donors struggle to find convenient ways to donate, leading to underutilized resources and environmental waste. 
Additionally, concerns about trust and transparency deter contributions, while logistical challenges complicate the donation process. 
To enhance charitable giving and promote sustainability, an effective e-donation website is needed to streamline the donation of products not in use,
foster communication, and ensure transparency in how donated items are used.*
